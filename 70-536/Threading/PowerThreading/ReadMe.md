# Jeffrey Richter's Power Threading Library #

The Power Threading Library consists of a number of classes to assist you with building responsive, reliable, and scalable applications and components. There are also a bunch of general-purpose utility classes in this library that have nothing to do with threading but I threw them in here anyway. 

The AsyncEnumerator class is particularly useful for developers who are trying to build responsive, reliable, and scalable applications and components. This class allows developers to leverage all the features of the APM using the simpler, more-familiar synchronous programming model. 

See the Power Threading Overview document in the root directory for more overview and detailed documentation.
